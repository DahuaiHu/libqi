General:
  - proper public API separation: QIAPI
  - basic ACL

  - Cleanup startup - less hand-described messages
  - Add publishing
  - Fast Local Call

Goals:
  - define an API

Transport:
  - see if ACE shm transport is more efficient than

Serialization:
  - Add support for 'dumb' serialization based on signature
  - abstract the serialisation backend

Test:
