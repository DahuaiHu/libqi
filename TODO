== QiMessaging ToDo ==

General:
  - proper public API separation: QIAPI
  - basic ACL
  - scoped_ptr when needed (PImpl)

Functor:
  - use boost::ref or boost::bind?

Messaging:
  - support address for client and server. (for example "soap://<ip>", "tcp://<ip>", "shm://<folder>", "ipc://<folder>")
  - Fast Local Call

Goals/Tasks:
  - define an API

Events:
  - define an API, maybe events are only

Transport:
  - Client/Subscriber: handle timeout on connect/call/read
  - let the possibility to avoid thread in server/subscriber. (add a receive method)
  - see if ACE shm transport is more efficient than

Serialization:
  - Add support for 'dumb' serialization based on signature
  - abstract the serialisation backend

Test:
  - test_serialization (base the test on test_boost_serialization)
  - more test
  - split performance test and autotest
  - test coverage

Tracing:
  - timestamp
  - bandwitdh
  - service/topics introspection
  - who use who?
